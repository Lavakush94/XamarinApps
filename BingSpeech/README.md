CaSI Cognitive Services
=======================

This sample demonstrates how to use some of the Microsoft Cognitive Services Bing Speech APIs in a Xamarin.Forms application. Note that `Constants.cs` should be updated with API keys for the different services.

The home page code behind has code to interpret the speech. The name Cassie is a trigger for the method to process speech and take further action. To use the app, click on the record icon, speak to the device, such as "Cassie, say hello to John". The app will respond and record the conversation in the default list view on the home page.
